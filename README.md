## 🚨 Problem  

Cancer remains one of the most pressing health crises in Tunisia and beyond:  

- **60 new infections every day** in Tunisia.  
- In **2023 alone, 22,000+ new cases** were reported, with patients facing delayed treatments, limited resources, and financial burdens.  
- Example: *Maryam, a 38-year-old mother of four from Kasserine, endured long waits and exhausting treatment journeys in addition to her illness.*  
- On the pharmaceutical side:  
  - It takes **$2.6B and 10–15 years** to bring a single drug to market.  
  - **90% of drugs fail in clinical trials**.  
  - Current “one-size-fits-all” testing ignores unique genetic and lifestyle differences.  
  - Patient data is often **fragmented, insecure, and untrusted**.

## 💡 Solution — A New Era in Drug Testing  

**TwinCure.AI** introduces **AI-powered Digital Twins secured by Blockchain**:  

- A **digital replica of each patient** integrating genetic, physiological, and lifestyle data.  
- **Simulate drug responses** virtually before real-world trials.  
- **Blockchain integration** ensures secure, transparent, and trustworthy data management.  

### 🧬 Workflow: From DNA to Digital Twin  
1. Sequence Input & Validation  
2. Genomic & Molecular Analysis  
3. Drug Design Engine  
4. Clinical Prediction  
5. Visualization & Interaction  

### ⚙️ Technical Highlights  
- **Machine Learning Models**: e.g., Random Forest to predict clinical markers from DNA sequences.  
- **Mathematical Optimization**: AI-driven drug design acceleration.  
- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: Immutable storage, tokenized data sharing, and secure marketplaces.
